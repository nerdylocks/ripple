Ripple Labs Technical exercise
======

For this thencical exercise I utilized AngularJS and the ripple-lib library to create a simple real time data visualization app. It pulls data using the Remote module from the Ripple network updates and visualizes transaction currency usage. For simplicities sake, I used a pie chart. A use case would be to create snapshots between time frames to analyze currency usage during a given time.

## Installation

      $ git clone https://github.com/nerdylocks/ripple abiy-ripple
      $ cd abiy-ripple
      $ bower install
      $ grunt server
      
## Thanks!
